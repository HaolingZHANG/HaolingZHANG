### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
[![trophy](https://github-profile-trophy.vercel.app/?username=haolingzhang)](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG)

I'm a senior algorithm engineer at BGI-Research and a member of George Church Institute of Regenesis. 
I led or participated in research of coding algorithms, architectures, software packages, and standardization in the field of DNA storage, published 4 papers including one in *Nature Computational Science*, under the guidance of [Prof. George Church](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SfDzdgEAAAAJ) at Harvard Medical School and [Dr. Yue Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=klXVMqMAAAAJ) at BGI-Research.
Besides, with my experience in engineering, mathematics and genomics, I have effectively undertaken the cooperation with coding scientists such as [Prof. Gennian Ge](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EyOXBysAAAAJ) at Capital Normal University and [Prof. Yiwei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3vEb9vQAAAAJ) at Shandong University.


Concurrently, I received valuable training from [Prof. Jesper TegnÃ©r](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_DUppAgAAAAJ) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, [Prof. â€ªHector Zenilâ€¬](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P6z3U-wAAAAJ) at University of Cambridge, and [Prof. Narsis Kiani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=odJXANUAAAAJ) at Karolinska Institute, [Dr. Chao-Han Huck Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TT3XJW8AAAAJ) at Georgia Institute of Technology on machine learning and causal discovery.
Moreover, I have collaborated with [Dr. Pin-Yu Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jxwlCUUAAAAJ) at IBM Research on adversarial robustness of artificial neural networks.

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer.
Since I have mainly worked in the scientific research community, most of my open source projects are programmed in Python.
I have also rewritten or reconstructed some other projects with low-level programming language into Python for better use by relevant scientists.
In the past three years, I have developed more than 25 algorithms/frameworks and have coded more than 400,000 lines.
The 19 open-source repositories are as follows, the remaining repositories will be released with sufficient tests and/or papers published.

Some key open-source repositories are:
1. [Chamaeleo](https://github.com/ntpz870817/Chamaeleo): an integrated evaluation platform for DNA-based data storage.
2. [DNASpiderWeb](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb): a general DNA-based data storage architecture and benchmark, the implementation of the work *SPIDER-WEB enables stable, repairable, and encryptable coding algorithms under arbitrary local biochemical constraints in DNA-based data storage*.
3. [DNA-storage-YYC](https://github.com/ntpz870817/DNA-storage-YYC): an implementation of the work *Towards Practical and Robust DNA-based Data Archiving using the Yinâ€“Yang Codec System* (published in *Nature Computational Science*).
4. [pyHEDGES](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/pyHEDGES): a rewritten implementation of the work *HEDGES Error-Correcting Code for DNA Storage Corrects Indels and Allows Sequence Constraints* in the Python platform ([C++](https://github.com/whpress/hedges) originally, published in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*).
5. [ReverseEncodingTree](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/ReverseEncodingTree): an implementation of the work *Evolving Neural Network through the Reverse Encoding Tree*.
6. [FasterHammingCalculator](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/FasterHammingCalculator): A large-scale Hamming distance calculation accelerator using the customized three-dimensional matrix (10 ~ 100 times).
7. [pymolBE](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/pymolBE): Customized batch exhibition of three-dimensional molecules based on the pymol framework.
8. [GenomeCompact](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/GenomeCompact): a lossless compression algorithm for T4 Phage.
